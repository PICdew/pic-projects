# Summary

This is a collection of PIC16, PIC18 and PIC32 MPLAB projects. The second half of
the project name indicate which Microchip PIC part was used. Projects ending with
".X" are MPLABX projects.

# level-servo-25K50.X

A gyro and accelorometer feeds a PIC18F25K50, which in turn controls a servo. The
idea is to keep the servo arm horizontal while moving and rocking the breadbard
to show that the gyro/accel is enough to counter the movement.
